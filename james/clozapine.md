# MEDICINE 2: Clozapine (updated 02/04/21)

## Summary:
This time around, I felt a clear flow through the survey and found a rhythm in how I researched and found information. But of course, iit is too early to tell whether I simply got lucky and found great sources early, or if I've improved in finding the relevant information. I also understood that there was a lot more to document; it is a shame that past survey answers cannot be seen as it would've been useful to reflect and expand on how I answered the previous diazepam surveys.


## Challenge 1: News Flash
My search methodology was to simply enter the name of the medicine into google, and check the first page headlines for information on the following:
- Repurposing known medicines for new uses
- Clinical trials process or results
- Shortages in medicine availability
- Prices hikes and major price changes
- New medicines for the treatment of diseases
- Side effects of using medicines

Side effects was the only one found.


### Side effects (translated)
The majority of side effects I found were using medical terminology. Obviously as I had no background, it was incredibly annoying as I had no idea what the words meant. Below is the 'translated' list that uses more common words.

- drowsiness
- dizziness, feeling unsteady, or having trouble keeping your balance
- increased salivation
- dry mouth
- restlessness
- headache
- constipation; nausea; stomach swelling or pain; or vomiting
- shaking hands that you cannot control
- fainting
- falling
- difficulty urinating or loss of bladder control
- confusion
- changes in vision
- shakiness
- severe muscle stiffness
- sweating
- changes in behavior
- unusual bleeding or bruising
- loss of appetite
- upset stomach
- yellowing of the skin or eyes
- pain in upper right part of the stomach
- lack of energy [^1]
- Flu like symptoms such as sore throat and fever
- Rapid breathing, fatigue, chest pain
- Seizures
- Weight gain [^2]


### Side effects with medical terminology [^1]
- Neutropenia
- Agranulocytosis
- Benign ethnic neutropenia
- Myocarditis
- Cardiomyopathy
- Tachycardia
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Venous thromboembolism
- Sedation
- Seizures
- Myoclonus
- Hypersalivation
- Constipation
- Nausea
- Parotid swelling
- Weight gain
- Hyperglycaemia
- Hyperlipidaemia
- Benign Fever
- Nocturnal enuresis
- Obsessive Compulsive Behaviour


### Serious side effects:
Clozapine can cause a serious blood condition. Because of the risks, clozapine is available only through a special restricted distribution program. A program has been set up by the manufacturers to be sure that people do not take it without necessary monitoring called Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). Do not drive a car, operate machinery, swim or climb when on medication. [^2]
One question was a bit confusing: 'discontinued or limited due to side effects.' What does limited specifically mean in this context? You could say a medicine is limited if it is not offered over the counter and requires a prescription. How limited are we talking?

## Challenge 2: Price Hike
Although a recent price hike wasn't found, one stemming back to the 90's was found. [^3] [^4] A program (Clozaril Patient Management System) said to be intended for the users safety (similar to the previous one mentioned) increased the price dramatically given the extra checks and services needed. This provoked considerable controversy "due in large part to having been both the first new antipsychotic medication to come to market in over a decade and the need for comprehensive safety monitoring within a decentralized health system" [^4]
Another paper then revealed that the price increase had doubled the cost, with an estimated ~$4750 being charged to the user for the CPMS safety monitoring system yearly. [^5]
Although in recent years, the price seems to be quite steady. [^6]

## Challenge 3: Circle of Life

### Summary
Two things to get from below, Wander AG were the original owners, which then were acquired by Sandoz. Novartis was created in 1996 through a merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz [^7]. A very useful search term for finding the original owners is 'synthesis', such that you can track the original creators.
