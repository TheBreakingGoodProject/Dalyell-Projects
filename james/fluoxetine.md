# MEDICINE 4: Fluoxetine (updated 24/04/2021)

## Reflection Summary

The challenges really started to feel robotic and boring. As I was noting and writing all this information down, it felt very much like a chore.

I began to note more details about how the information is presented on the sites:

-   First impressions (is this a news article or a blog?)
    
-   Readability
    
-   Organisation of information
    
-   Etc.

I felt very much a decline in how I was absorbing the information; like a typist who was just noting what I read and formatting it. Though this is expected as once you do so many challenges, it is hard not to fall into a rhythm without thinking too much about the information.

“In one of the most egregious examples of price gouging, the retail price of fluoxetine (the generic form of the antidepressant Prozac) in California skyrocketed from $9 to $69, a mind-numbing 667 percent jump”

“One version of fluoxetine saw its price jump by a mind-numbing 879 percent, according to Rx Savings Solutions, a consultant to health plans and employers.”

"In the political climate we live in and the conversations we're having, that there are more drug price increases this year -- you would think that wouldn't be the case," Michael Rea, founder and CEO of Rx Savings Solutions, said. "It defines the difficulty that consumers have."

“Rea said drug prices are rising because of a combination of pressure from shareholders to deliver higher profits.”

In the late 1960s evidence began to emerge suggesting a significant role of serotonin in MDD. For example, a postmortem study revealed decreased concentrations of serotonin in depressive suicides (Shaw, Eccleston, & Camps, 1967). As a result, the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly began developing ligands that would selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at serotonin transporters, and as a result would increase serotonin concentrations within the synaptic cleft to further stimulate postsynaptic serotonin receptors. In 1974, the first report on the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) LY110140 (fluoxetine) was published and in that publication the authors suggested that fluoxetine would be an antidepressant drug (Wong, Horng, Bymaster, Hauser, & Molloy, 1974).

In the early 1970s, evidence of the role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) in depression began to emerge and the hypothesis that enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission would be a viable mechanism to mediate antidepressant response was put forward. On the basis of this hypothesis, efforts to develop agents that inhibit the uptake of 5-HT from the synaptic cleft were initiated. These studies led to the discovery and development of the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac; Eli Lilly), which was approved for the treatment of depression by the US FDA in 1987.
