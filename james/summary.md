# Reflection Summary

## Challenge 1

At this stage (mid way through the total challenge), I began to feel very drained. The process seemed incredibly repetitive, though I wouldn’t imagine regular people would repeat the challenges so often. I also won’t neglect that this can be blamed on my own time management, as rather than pacing these challenges out, I tended to do multiple challenges in one go.

Though I also noted that I naturally picked up better research skills. Being able to inherently judge a source, rather than reference a guide on what sources are credible as I previously did.


I have also begun to realise a huge problem with many of these website sources. Their UI is incredibly behind on what current expectations are in other fields of the web. I only realised this now as one site in particular had a much higher cohesiveness and readability - more similar to that of a social media website. This broke the previous expectations I had of medical websites, as I thought that it simply wasn’t possible to have such qualities due to the lack of execution by these big medical websites.

## Challenge 2

This time around, I felt a clear flow through the survey and found a rhythm in my research. But of course, it is too early to tell whether I simply got lucky and found great sources early, or if I’ve actually improved in finding the relevant information.

I also understood that there was a lot more to document; it is a shame that past survey answers cannot be seen as it would’ve been useful to reflect and expand on how I answered the previous diazepam surveys.

In future, I will give an emphasis on my research process and emotions felt on the way. There are a lot of details which initially go over your head.

## Challenge 4 & 5
 
The challenges really started to feel robotic and boring. As I was noting and writing all this information down, it felt very much like a chore.

I began to note more details about how the information is presented on the sites:

- First impressions (is this a news article or a blog?)

- Readability

- Organisation of information

- Etc.

I felt very much a decline in how I was absorbing the information; like a typist who was just noting what I read and formatting it. Though this is expected as once you do so many challenges, it is hard not to fall into a rhythm without thinking too much about the information.
