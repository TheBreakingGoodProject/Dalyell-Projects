## CHOSEN MEDICINES

In my opinion, there are many essential medicines that are often neglected; medicine that people may need, but the process of finding and getting treatment is so daunting, that the patient is unlikely to get the help that they need. Should the process be so daunting? My anecdotal thoughts are that those with mental health and/or drug issues fit that criteria. Could this process be made better accustomed for those in such situations? Therefore, medicines related to that area will be my primary focus.

**Clozapine**: used to treat certain mental/mood disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders

## Essential Medicines Survey Notes

### Introduction Survey

- “Where do you live? (country).” Replace text input with dropdown menu?

- “Have your studies and/or career involved health, medicine, chemistry or pharmaceutical topics?” Replace text input with [yes]  [no] buttons?

- “I consent to my name and/or GitHub username being used to acknowledge my participation in publications originating from this project.” Possible to select all answers (both yes and no), could implement limitation for contrary answers.

### Challenge 1: News Flash

- Challenge context. News article that I’ve spontaneously seen? Or have reached out to see.

- Do I answer survey questions from memory? Or do I reference source material directly?

- Didn’t know the difference between adverse effect and side effect (https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/adverse-event-not-the-same-as-side-effect)

- “What medication have you heard about in the context of side effects of using medicines?” Replace paragraph text input with one line input

### Challenge 2 Price Hike

- What is the purpose of asking to look up a specific website and search results? Is this to see how well we are at looking up a website or is this to check the actual information. If it’s the latter, why not use a web scraper?

### Challenge 3 Circle Of Life

- Spelling error in description: “Excellent! You chose diazepam. Now that you have chosen an essential medicine, it is time to look it up on our public database. We will use this **databaes** to find out which company currently owns the rights to diazepam, what its trade name is and when it was first approved. You can find this information in the following link.”

- Confusion about given database when chosen medicine is not found in database.
