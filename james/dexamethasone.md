Periodic blood work to monitor your complete blood count (CBC) as well as the function of other organs (such as your kidneys and liver) will also be ordered by your doctor.” [^1]

## Challenge 2: Price Hike

Price increased in 2020 137% from 0.59 to 1.39 per unit. The drug is linked to COVID-19, and Trump was given the drug.

“Dexamethasone, the steroid drug President Donald Trump was recently prescribed to treat COVID-19, has seen a price increase of 137 percent in the last few months, according to nonprofit drug research firm 46brooklyn. “

“The price of the steroid spiked from $0.59 per unit to $1.39 per unit and is currently listed in shortage from both the FDA and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists”

“The price spike is concerning, considering the growing importance of the drug in treating COVID-19, 46brooklyn wrote. A study released in June showed the drug reduced COVID-19 deaths by one-third for those who had been sick for more than a week and were on mechanical ventilators, but had no impact on patients receiving no respiratory support. The drug has a history of dramatic price increases and reductions.”

“President Trump was given the steroid Oct. 3 in response to his blood oxygen levels dropping when he was hospitalized for COVID-19. The steroid is usually recommended for hospitalized patients who need oxygen or are on ventilators.”

Concerns over whether or not the drug being administered to Trump will increase the price, as Hydroxychloroquine once did.

“On Tuesday 16th of June, new research was published by scientists from Oxford University which showed that the use of Dexamethasone, a low-dose steroid treatment, on patients suffering from COVID-19 reduced deaths by a third for patients on ventilators and by a fifth for patients receiving oxygen treatment.”

“The price may seem steady for the time being; however, as with Hydroxychloroquine, the “Trump effect” led to a 1000% increase in demand and this, effectively, resulted to demand and supply issue which in turn increased the price for this usually affordable medicine.”

Price hike within the U.S. and further price hikes in the Netherlands. Diazepam was also mentioned to have significant price hikes in multiple countries.

  

“The United States itself only showed one price increase - for one version of dexamethasone”

“The largest price increase was for dexamethasone, the only existing treatment to have shown increased survival data, which rose nearly three-fold in the Netherlands (+ 277%).”

“Diazepam prices increased in Lithuania (+167%), Denmark (+128%), Canada (114%), New Zealand (+100%) and United Arab Emirates (100%).”

Merck and Co Inc must be the first owner as otherwise the patent would have already existed at the time, as it would be too soon for it to have expired.

Application for patent filed by Merck and Co Inc in 1962

Expired in 1983

If the patent expired, the trail must end as all companies could produce it.

“When a drug's U.S. patent expires, manufacturers other than the initial developer may take advantage of an abbreviated approval process to introduce lower-priced generic versions.” [^4]
