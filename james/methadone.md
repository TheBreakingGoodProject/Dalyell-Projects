# MEDICINE 3: Methadone (updated 24/04/2021)

## Reflection Summary

At this stage (mid way through the total challenge), I began to feel very drained. The process seemed incredibly repetitive, though I wouldn’t imagine regular people would repeat the challenges so often. I also won’t neglect that this can be blamed on my own time management, as rather than pacing these challenges out, I tended to do multiple challenges in one go.

Though I also noted that I naturally picked up better research skills. Being able to inherently judge a source, rather than reference a guide on what sources are credible as I previously did.

I have also begun to realise a huge problem with many of these website sources. Their UI is incredibly behind on what current expectations are in other fields of the web. I only realised this now as one site in particular had a much higher cohesiveness and readability - more similar to that of a social media website. This broke the previous expectations I had of medical websites, as I thought that it simply wasn’t possible to have such qualities due to the lack of execution by these big medical websites.


## Challenge 1: News Flash

During my initial search of methadone, the only information found on the first page was The topic of side effects. These then included:

### Side Effects

#### Your brain

-   Irritability
    
-   Dizziness
    
-   Depression
    
-   Dependence
    
-   Coma and death (in overdose)
    

#### Your mouth

-   Dry Mouth
    

#### Your body

-   Sweating
    
-   Low sex drive/sexual dysfunction
    
-   Irregular periods
    
-   Your gastrointestinal system
    
-   Constipation
    
-   Nausea
    
-   Vomiting
    

#### Your veins and arteries

-   Injecting methadone can lead to
    
-   Collapsed veins
    
-   Blocked blood vessels
    

#### Long term effects

-   Reduced libido
    
-   Problems with menstrual cycle (women) [^1]
    
#### Other

-   Tiredness
    
-   Stomach pain
    
-   Shortness of breath
    
-   Chestpain
    
-   Slowed or shallowed breathing
    
-   Dilated pupils
    
-   Teary eyes
    
-   Runny nose
    
-   Chills
    
-   Addiction
    

This drug has boxed warnings. A boxed warning is the most serious warning from the FDA [^2]

Methadone will not cause damage to major organs of the body. Prolonged use of methadone will not cause any physical damage (doesn’t mention libido?)

Withdrawal develops more slowly and is less intense than withdrawal from heroin. This will begin 1 to 3 days after the last dose and will peak around the 6th day, but can last longer [^3]

Using methadone without a prescription from a doctor, or selling or giving it to someone else, is illegal. There are also laws against forging or altering a prescription or making false representation to obtain methadone or a prescription for the drug. It is also illegal to inject methadone. [^3]

The layout of the website was a lot more intuitive and easy to read, unlike all of the previous sites which were simply a long list that you needed to stare at. This was instead interactive, and divided information up into their own relevant categories, such that it was easier to see connections and not get overwhelmed with information.

This was the first website with a pleasant design (mostly through its modern web design (colour scheme, interactive, great use of images and diagrams, clean look, vertical slice layout).

This difference now only made me realise how much improvement is needed in regards to UI and the previous sites. This was something I simply didn’t pick up on prior.

## Challenge 2: Price Hike

I started to naturally look for more reliable sources, such as if the site looked professional, where author background and contact details are available, and were the websites of .gov or .org domains.

Prior to this I usually only looked at any of the top links provided by Google, as they were the most convenient. And for previous challenges, I had to actively look at the checklist to verify if the material was reliable, which was quite a slow and repetitive task. Now it seems to be at the back of my mind inherently.

Additionally, for my site evaluations (on whether or not they seemed reliable), I also started to include a comment on the general layout, whether it had an impressive design, looked professional, or looked very far from it.

I also started to note the placement of each website in regards to the Google search, which may give insight on how well Google is at ranking relevant pages.

1st link: [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/heroin-withdrawal-generic-drug-price-hike](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/29/heroin-withdrawal-generic-drug-price-hike)

-   .com website, however, is a news article
    
-   Looks professional
    
-   Article is from 2018
   
The article mentioned a 700% price spike in the drug ‘buprenorphine’, which is “an alternative to methadone... [that] ...offers a reduced risk of overdose compared with methadone.” Although this article is not related to methadone directly, I noted that perhaps a trend could be found?

2nd link: [https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/renewed-calls-to-fully-subsidise-methadone-treatme](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/renewed-calls-to-fully-subsidise-methadone-treatme)

-   .org website
    
-   Author background and contact details
    
-   Looks professional
    

Article mentions talks to end a situation where patients are “forced to pay pharmacist dispensing fees … up to $75 a week.” Although no price hike is mentioned, it gives a perspective that many of those affected do not have the funds necessary to continue treatment, highlighting the importance of how a price hike can affect patients.

4th link: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/08/27/methadone-maker-doubles-price/8bb7842b-1640-41c9-a0d4-8a7726ea04d9/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/08/27/methadone-maker-doubles-price/8bb7842b-1640-41c9-a0d4-8a7726ea04d9/)

“The main U.S. producer of methadone… is doubling its price for the drug.”

The reasoning given is that there were higher costs for “raw materials, manufacturing and administration expenses, Mallinckrodt informed its customers doubling the price of cherry-flavoured liquid methadone from 37$ per quart to 74$.”

At first glance, this statement seems very broad and comes off as an excuse.

I also began to note that news articles are very hard to dissect with regards to information. There rarely are any sub-headings and lack a clear structure. This is very annoying as I have to scroll through walls of text with little direction in mind.

Again mentions a call for federal government subsidy for methadone treatment

Methadone was a drug developed in 1937 in Germany by scientists working for I.G. Farbenindustrie AG. Originally, it was sought after as a response to Germany’s opium shortage. It was additionally widely used by the German army in WW2.

“After the war, all German patents, trade names and research records were requisitioned and expropriated by the allied forces. The records on the research work of the I.G. Farbenkonzern at the Farbwerke Hoechst were confiscated by the U.S. Department of Commerce Intelligence, investigated by a Technical Industrial Committee of the U.S. Department of State and then brought to the US.”

“Since the patent rights of the I.G. Farbenkonzern and Farbwerke Hoechst were no longer protected; each pharmaceutical company interested in the formula could purchase the rights for commercial production of methadone for just one dollar (MOLL 1990).”

No date is found on when the research was confiscated.

“When the war was over, German patents and other assets were distributed to the allies. IG Farben’s developments were confiscated by the US Department of Commerce Intelligence division and brought to the US. By 1947, the drug was approved as a painkiller in this country.”

“After the war all German patents and trade names were requisitioned by the allies. The Hoechst factory fell in the American sector so it was they who took over control of production and investigated the wartime work of the plant.” “The formulae for methadone and all the other Hoechst products were distributed freely around the world…”

NO YEAR FOUND !!! Very frustrating.

Initially I researched a bit about the remaining history of the major companies which produce Methadone today. But I then concluded that as the research was distributed freely, the additional events surrounding the companies do not matter, as regardless, it could have ended up in any companies’ hands.
