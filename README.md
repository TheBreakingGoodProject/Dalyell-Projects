# Dalyell-Projects

In semester 2 of 2021 we welcome students from The University of Sydney who will be taking part in our project *Co-Designing Online Learning Processes* along with our group leaders.

This project is being run as part of the [Science Dalyell Showcase](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/SCDL1991) and is being supervised by [Dr. Yaela Golumbic](https://github.com/yaelago) and [Dr. Kymberley Scroggie](https://github.com/kym834).
